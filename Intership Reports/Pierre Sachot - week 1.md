# Pierre Sachot internship report week 1

1. First task :
  During this first week in Kichwa coders company, I worked on divers topics. 
The first one was to find errors in examples to understand how github works and how to use it. 

1. Second Task :
  The second was to work on Katacada, which is a website which permite to create scenarios, and to implement a shell online in a Website. 
This is based on a linux shell, and in the configuration file, you can choose to use Java, docker or others installations.
For our project, which consists to implement the january library online, to allow people to try it without installing it on their own PC. 
This was really interesting because I never did that before, and I would like to understand it, and understand how to implement it. 
We achieved to download a git project and to generate it, now, to continue the integration, we need to wait Yannick Mayeur’s maven build.

1. Final Task :
  My last mission was to create a game of life, including the january library. 
I worked on this project for the last two days, and I arrived to something working, the problem is that only one direction is evolving and cells who would need to die are keeping alive…
